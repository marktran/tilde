# Research Inbox Responsibility

### Goal

The research inbox stays deduplicated, prioritized, and converted into clear
next actions for the team's active questions.

### Requires

- `inbox-items`: a current view of new papers, links, notes, or questions
  awaiting triage
- `active-questions`: research questions, initiatives, or watch areas that
  should influence priority
- `available-owners`: people or roles who can accept follow-up work

### Maintains

- `triage`: the current triage truth. Its subscribable parts are the three
  `####` facets below — each `####` part *is* a facet, naming its own fingerprint
  unit, its `Requires.<facet>` ↔ `Maintains.<facet>` subscription symbol, and its
  `published/<facet>/…` subtree.
- immaterial everywhere: scan timestamps and submission receipt ids
- postcondition: each item is either linked to an existing cluster or starts a
  new cluster with a concise rationale
- postcondition: priority reflects relevance to active questions, novelty,
  credibility, and urgency
- postcondition: the strongest source is preserved for any duplicate set; an
  item is never discarded solely because it is duplicated

#### report

Material: a scan-friendly summary of clusters, priorities, and next actions —
each follow-up names an owner role, next step, and reason. A downstream that
surfaces the triage report subscribes here and wakes when priorities move, not
when the topic register or ignore list churns.

#### topics

Material: durable topic clusters, canonical sources, and duplicate
cross-references, carried forward across renders.

#### ignored

Material: items that do not deserve follow-up, with enough rationale to avoid
repeated re-triage.

### Continuity

- input-driven: new inbox items wake triage; they should be triaged before they
  are more than one business day old
- self-driven: re-surface stale high-priority items when no owner has accepted
  the follow-up

### Invariants

- Keep summaries short enough for a researcher to scan before deciding what to
  read.
- Do not invent claims that are not present in the submitted item.

### Execution

```prose
let normalized = call inbox-ingestor
  inbox-items: inbox-items

let clustered = call topic-clusterer
  normalized-items: normalized.normalized-items
  batch-duplicate-hints: normalized.batch-duplicate-hints
  active-questions: active-questions
  prior-topics: triage.topics
  prior-ignored: triage.ignored

let ranking = call priority-scorer
  clustered-items: clustered.clustered-items
  active-questions: active-questions

let report = call action-planner
  clustered-items: clustered.clustered-items
  priority-ranking: ranking
  ignored-item-log: clustered.ignored-item-log
  available-owners: available-owners

return {
  report: report,
  topics: clustered.topic-map-updates,
  ignored: clustered.ignored-item-log
}
```
