# Assess Customer Impact

### Shape

- `self`: classify impact evidence and separate known customer effects from internal risk
- `prohibited`: declaring customer impact without a source or making remediation promises

### Parameters

- `signal-summary`: normalized facts, timestamps, sources, contradictions, and gaps

### Returns

- `impact-assessment`: severity, affected surfaces, confidence, and customer-safe wording
- `open-impact-questions`: missing evidence needed to clarify scope or severity

### Strategies

- When evidence conflicts, report the conflict and lower confidence.
- Prefer narrow affected-surface language over broad outage language unless broad impact is proven.
