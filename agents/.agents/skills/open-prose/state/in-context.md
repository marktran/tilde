# In-Context State Management

This document describes how the Prose VM tracks execution state using **structured narration** in the conversation history. This is a supported alternative to file-based state (`filesystem.md`) for small service and system runs.

## Overview

In-context state uses text-prefixed markers to persist state within the conversation. The VM "thinks aloud" about execution—what you say becomes what you remember.

**Key principle:** Your conversation history IS the VM's working memory.

---

## When to Use In-Context State

In-context state is appropriate for:

| Factor | In-Context | Use File-Based Instead |
|--------|------------|------------------------|
| Statement count | < 30 statements | >= 30 statements |
| Parallel branches | < 5 concurrent | >= 5 concurrent |
| Resolved service/system calls | 0-2 calls | >= 3 calls |
| Nested depth | <= 2 levels | > 2 levels |
| Expected duration | < 5 minutes | >= 5 minutes |

Announce your state mode at run start:

```
OpenProse Run Start
   State mode: in-context (system is small, fits in context)
```

---

## The Narration Protocol

Use **compact markers** to track state with minimal token overhead. The VM's conversation history is the primary state—markers exist for clarity and potential resumption, not as verbose logs.

### Core Markers

| Marker | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `N→ name ✓` | Statement N complete, bound to name | `1→ research ✓` |
| `N→ ✓` | Anonymous session complete | `3→ ✓` |
| `N→ ✗ error` | Statement failed | `2→ ✗ timeout` |
| `∥ [a b c]` | Parallel started | `∥ [security perf style]` |
| `∥ [a✓ b✓ c→]` | Parallel progress | `∥ [security✓ perf✓ style→]` |
| `∥ done` | Parallel joined | `∥ done` |
| `loop:I/M` | Loop iteration | `loop:2/5` |
| `loop exit` | Loop condition satisfied | `loop:3/5 exit` |
| `#ID name` | Block invocation | `#43 process` |
| `#ID done` | Block complete | `#43 done` |
| `try→` | Entering try | `try→` |
| `catch→` | Entering catch | `catch→ err` |
| `finally→` | Entering finally | `finally→` |

## Narration Patterns by Construct

### Session Statements

```
1→ research ✓
```

That's it. One line. The host `spawn_session` call and result are in the conversation—no need to narrate them again.

### Parallel Blocks

```
∥ [a b c]
  [spawn_session calls for a, b, c]
∥ [a✓ b✓ c✓] done
```

### Loop Blocks

```
loop:1/5
  3→ synthesis ✓
loop:2/5
  3→ synthesis ✓
loop:3/5 exit(**complete**)
```

### Error Handling

```
try→
  2→ ✗ timeout
catch→ err
  3→ recovery ✓
finally→
  4→ cleanup ✓
```

### Block Invocation

```
#1 process(data,5)
  5→ parts ✓
  #2 process(parts[0],4)
    6→ subparts ✓
  #2 done
  7→ combined ✓
#1 done
```

Block invocations nest visually. The `#ID` uniquely identifies each invocation for scoped bindings.

### Scoped Bindings

When inside a block, bindings are implicitly scoped to the current `#ID`:

```
#43 process
  5→ result ✓   (scoped to #43)
```

### Service and System Calls

```
call researcher(topic:"quantum") → result ✓
call synthesis(findings:result) → report ✓
```

---

## Context Serialization

**In-context state passes values, not references.** The VM holds binding values directly in conversation history.

When passing context to sessions, format appropriately:

| Context Size | Strategy |
|--------------|----------|
| < 2000 chars | Pass verbatim |
| 2000-8000 chars | Summarize to key points |
| > 8000 chars | Extract essentials only |

**Limitation:** In-context state cannot support arbitrarily large bindings. For large intermediate values, use file-based or PostgreSQL state.

## Complete Execution Trace Example

```prose
agent researcher:
  model: balanced

let research = session: researcher
  prompt: "Research AI safety"

parallel:
  a = session "Analyze risk A"
  b = session "Analyze risk B"

loop until **analysis complete** (max: 3):
  session "Synthesize"
    context: { a, b, research }
```

**Compact narration:**
```
1→ research ✓
∥ [a b]
∥ [a✓ b✓] done
loop:1/3
  3→ synthesis ✓
loop:2/3 exit(**complete**)
---end
```

That's the entire execution trace in 7 lines instead of 40+. The host `spawn_session` calls and their results are in the conversation history—the markers just track position and completion.

---

## What the VM Tracks Implicitly

The VM's conversation naturally contains:

| Information | Where It Lives |
|-------------|----------------|
| Agent/block definitions | Read at run start, in early context |
| Binding values | `spawn_session` results in conversation |
| Current position | VM knows what it just executed |
| Loop iteration | VM is counting |
| Parallel status | VM spawned the sessions, sees returns |
| Call stack | VM invoked the blocks |

The compact markers exist for **clarity and resumption**, not as the primary state store. The conversation IS the state.

---

## Independence from File-Based State

In-context state and file-based state (`filesystem.md`) are **independent approaches**. You choose one or the other based on system complexity.

- **In-context**: State lives in conversation history
- **File-based**: State lives in `<openprose-root>/runs/{id}/`

They are not designed to be complementary—pick the appropriate mode at run start.

---

## Summary

In-context state management:

1. Uses **compact markers** (`1→ research ✓`) instead of verbose narration
2. Relies on **conversation history** as the primary state
3. Is appropriate for **smaller, simpler systems** (<30 statements)
4. Generates **minimal tokens** per statement
5. Enables resumption by reading prior markers

The conversation IS the state. Markers provide structure and resumability without token bloat.
