# Contract Markdown

Contract Markdown is the human-facing `*.prose.md` format for OpenProse
services, systems, gateways, tests, patterns, and responsibilities. It uses
tiny YAML frontmatter for file identity, then Markdown sections for the
human-facing language: contracts, runtime hints, shape, execution, and standing
goals.

The format optimizes for two readers:

1. Humans scanning a workflow.
2. Agents extracting contracts and wiring services and systems.

## Authored Shapes

`prose run` accepts two authored shapes:

- **Service** — an atomic execution boundary: one contract, one session, one
  workspace. A service does work directly.
- **System** — a composition boundary: one contract whose implementation is a
  graph of services and systems. A system owns domain intent and concrete
  wiring.

A run starts from the file the caller invokes, which may be either a service or a system.

A **test** is a harness executed by `prose test`: it supplies fixtures, runs a
subject service or system, and evaluates assertions.

A **pattern** is not domain work by itself. It is a reusable agent design
pattern: slots, config, invariants, and delegation rules for how filled
services interact. Patterns are not run directly; systems instantiate them
inside `### Services`.

A **responsibility** is responsibility-oriented source, not a direct run
target. It defines a standing goal that must remain true over time. The
compiler lowers it into responsibility, concrete triggers, and activation
intent.
Pressure is runtime feedback produced when the Reactor judges the standing goal
to be drifting, down, or blocked.

A **gateway** is optional ingress source, not a direct run target. It describes
how time or the outside world enters OpenProse: schedules, local HTTP routes,
webhooks, or provider events. The compiler lowers gateways into concrete
serve-facing `triggers[]`.

Gateway sections are intentionally small:

```markdown
---
name: github-stars
kind: gateway
---

### Receives

- POST /webhooks/github/stars
- Provider: GitHub
- Event: star

### Emits

- high-intent-stargazer-outreach.evidence-change

### Payload

Pass the webhook payload as activation event context.
```

## Core Shape

````markdown
---
name: research-report
kind: service
---

### Requires

- `topic`: the question to investigate

### Ensures

- `report`: concise answer with sources

### Strategies

- when sources are thin: broaden search terms

### Execution

```prose
let findings = call researcher
  topic: topic

return findings
```
````

## Header Hierarchy

| Level | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `#` | Optional human title. Ignored by Forme unless no frontmatter `name` exists. |
| `##` | Inline service boundary in multi-service files. |
| `###` | Section inside the current service or system. |
| `####`+ | Free-form nested documentation inside a section. |

`##` is reserved for inline service names so files can contain several
services without ambiguous parsing. Contract sections use `###` so they work
uniformly in standalone service files and inside inline services.

## Canonical Sections

Forme and the Prose VM recognize these `###` sections case-insensitively:

| Section | Applies To | Purpose |
|---------|------------|---------|
| `### Description` | system, service, test, pattern | Human summary. Preserved for readers; not used as a contract |
| `### Services` | system | Services or systems Forme should resolve and wire |
| `### Requires` | system, service, test, pattern slots | Inputs or dependencies the caller/container must provide |
| `### Ensures` | system, service, pattern | Outputs or postconditions the service, system, or pattern commits to |
| `### Errors` | system, service | Declared failures the service or system may signal |
| `### Invariants` | system, service, pattern | Properties that must hold regardless of outcome |
| `### Strategies` | system, service, test | Guidance for judgment calls and edge cases |
| `### Environment` | system, service | Runtime variables supplied by host infrastructure |
| `### Runtime` | system, service | Execution hints such as `persist` and `model` |
| `### Memory` | service | Declared reads from and writes to persistent agent memory. Only meaningful when `### Runtime` sets `persist: project` or `persist: user` |
| `### Skills` | system, service | Agent harness skills the component requires the host harness to provide. See [Skills](#skills) |
| `### Tools` | system, service, responsibility | Host tools the component requires the host environment to provide. See [Tools](#tools) |
| `### Shape` | service | Capability boundaries: self, delegates, and prohibited work |
| `### Wiring` | system | Explicit Level 2 wiring declaration |
| `### Execution` | system, service | ProseScript choreography that pins execution |
| `### Fixtures` | test | Test inputs supplied without prompting |
| `### Expects` | test | Positive natural-language assertions |
| `### Expects Not` | test | Negative natural-language assertions |
| `### Slots` | pattern | Services a pattern requires from its caller |
| `### Config` | pattern | Pattern-level parameters and defaults |
| `### Delegation` | pattern | ProseScript or pseudocode describing slot interaction |
| `### Goal` | responsibility | The invariant: what must remain true over time |
| `### Continuity` | responsibility | How time qualifies the obligation |
| `### Criteria` | responsibility | What counts as satisfactory fulfillment |
| `### Constraints` | responsibility | What must remain bounded or prohibited |
| `### Fulfillment` | responsibility | Optional hint naming a system or service that may fulfill the responsibility |
| `### Schedule` | gateway | Optional cron-like ingress cadence |
| `### Receives` | gateway | Optional HTTP/event ingress description |
| `### Emits` | gateway | Responsibility trigger id the gateway should emit |
| `### Payload` | gateway | Notes about the event payload shape |

Unknown `###` sections are preserved as documentation. They are not contract
sections unless a future spec names them.

## File Extraction

Interpreters parse a file in this order:

1. Read YAML frontmatter for identity metadata (`name`, `kind`; `kind: test`
   files also declare `subject`).
2. Create the file-level service, system, gateway, test, pattern, or
   responsibility from the frontmatter.
3. Attach all `###` sections before the first `##` to the file-level entry.
4. For every `## {name}` heading, create an inline service named `{name}`.
5. Attach subsequent `###` sections to that inline service until the next `##`.

Example:

````markdown
---
name: content-pipeline
kind: system
---

### Services

- `review`
- `polish`

### Requires

- `draft`: text to improve

### Ensures

- `final`: polished text

## review

### Shape

- `self`: read draft, write feedback
- `prohibited`: editing final copy

### Requires

- `draft`: text to review

### Ensures

- `feedback`: editorial notes

## polish

### Requires

- `draft`: original text
- `feedback`: editorial notes

### Ensures

- `final`: polished text
````

The file-level system requires `draft` and ensures `final`. It also
contains inline services `review` and `polish`.

## Responsibilities

Responsibility-oriented repositories may contain `kind: responsibility` files:

```markdown
---
name: qualified-stargazer-outreach
kind: responsibility
id: 067NC4KG01RG50R40M30E20918
---

### Goal

High-intent GitHub stargazers are identified, enriched, and thoughtfully
followed up with.

### Continuity

- New high-intent stargazers should not remain unattended for more than one
  business day.
- Outreach history should prevent duplicate contact without new evidence.

### Criteria

- Qualification includes GitHub activity, company context, and plausible pain.
- Outreach includes a specific OpenProse program idea or sample result.

### Constraints

- Do not send generic outreach.
- Keep enrichment and outreach costs bounded.

### Tools

(none)
```

Responsibilities are semantic and normative. They do not directly define
gateways, tests, schedules, listeners, queues, or implementation steps.
Load `responsibility-runtime.md` and `concepts/responsibility.md` for
responsibility semantics.

## Services

Declare a system's graph with `### Services`:

```markdown
### Services

- `researcher`
- `writer`
```

Simple service names are Markdown list items. Structured `### Services` entries
use a fenced YAML list:

````markdown
### Services

```yaml
- name: reviewed-result
  pattern: std/patterns/worker-critic
  with:
    worker: writer
    critic: reviewer
  config:
    max_rounds: 4
```
````

Use `with:` only for slot bindings. Use `config:` for pattern parameters.

## Structured Blocks

Use Markdown structure directly for Markdown: section headers, bullets, and
tables are the language surface and should not be wrapped in code fences.

Use fenced `yaml` only for structured YAML declarations such as pattern
instances in `### Services` or maps in `### Memory`. Use fenced `prose` only for
ProseScript in `### Execution` and pattern `### Delegation`. Do not use
`markdown` or `text` fences as structured data formats.

## How Systems Compose Work

Systems compose work in four ways:

1. **Plain services.** List service names in `### Services`; Forme wires them by matching `### Requires` to `### Ensures`.
2. **Subsystems.** List a `kind: system` file in `### Services`; Forme recursively wires it and treats the subsystem as one graph node.
3. **Explicit wiring.** Add `### Wiring` when a system must pin exact bindings between services.
4. **Pattern instances.** Use a fenced `yaml` declaration in `### Services` with `pattern:`, `with:`, and optional `config:`.

Canonical pattern instance shape inside a system's `### Services` section:

```yaml
- name: reviewed-draft
  pattern: std/patterns/worker-critic
  with:
    worker: writer
    critic: reviewer
  config:
    max_rounds: 3
```

`pattern:` names a `kind: pattern` file. `with:` binds slots to services,
subsystems, or nested pattern instances. `config:` sets pattern parameters.
After expansion, the named pattern instance behaves like a graph node in the
system.

Only `kind: system` files instantiate patterns directly. A `kind: service` does
work; it does not call a pattern. A `kind: test` names a service or system as
its subject; it does not test a pattern directly. Nested pattern declarations
are allowed only as slot values inside another pattern instance's `with:`
block.

## Runtime and Shape

Runtime hints and behavioral boundaries are also sections:

```markdown
### Runtime

- `persist`: project
- `model`: sonnet

### Shape

- `self`: evaluate sources, score confidence
- `delegates`:
  - `summarizer`: compression
- `prohibited`: direct web scraping
```

## Memory

A service with `persist: project` or `persist: user` in `### Runtime` reaches
into memory files that outlive the current run. The `### Memory` section
declares what that service *reads from* and *writes to* memory — the
persistent equivalent of `### Requires` / `### Ensures`:

````markdown
### Memory

```yaml
reads:
  - high_water_mark: ISO timestamp of the newest item processed in a prior run
  - cumulative_registry: map of id → { first_seen, last_seen, hit_count }
writes:
  - high_water_mark: advanced to the newest item observed this run
  - cumulative_registry: merged with items observed this run
  - last_run_at: ISO timestamp of this run's completion
```
````

Rules:

- `### Memory` is only meaningful when `### Runtime` sets `persist: project`
  or `persist: user`. A service with execution-scoped memory (`persist:
  true`) does not need this section — its memory dies with the run.
- `reads:` names fields the service expects to exist in memory; missing
  fields should be handled as "first run" rather than as errors.
- `writes:` names fields the service commits to update on a successful run.
  A failed run that does not reach the memory write leaves state untouched
  — see `guidance/authoring.md`, State and Memory Authoring.
- Fields that downstream responsibilities also need (high-water marks,
  cursors, run IDs) should *also* appear at the top level of `### Ensures`
  — see `guidance/authoring.md`, State and Memory Authoring. Memory is for
  the next invocation of *this* service; the return value is for the next
  responsibility.

See `prose.md` (Persistent Agents) and `state/filesystem.md` (Memory
Scoping) for the on-disk format of memory files.

## Skills

A system or service that depends on the host agent's harness skills declares
them in a `### Skills` section. The compiler resolves the named skills against
the host's installed skills before emitting the component's IR, and `prose
compile` fails closed with a `skill_unresolved` diagnostic if any are missing.

```markdown
### Skills

- document-skills:pdf
- document-skills:xlsx
```

Skill names use the `namespace:name` colon form that matches the plugin
marketplace convention shown in `/skill` invocations.

Rules:

- System-level declarations apply to every sub-service inside the system.
  Service-level declarations are *additive*, not exclusive — declaring `###
  Skills` on a `## sub-service` does not remove the system-level skills, it
  adds to them.
- The compiler resolves each declared skill by looking, in order, in:
  1. The project's `./skills/` directory.
  2. `~/.claude/skills/`.
  3. `~/.codex/skills/`.
  4. `~/.agents/skills/`.
- If a declared skill cannot be resolved in any of those paths, `prose compile`
  fails closed with a `skill_unresolved` diagnostic naming the skill and the
  paths that were searched.

The compiler program implements this resolution rule; see
`skills/open-prose/compiler/index.prose.md` (`skills_resolver`) for the
program-level contract.

### BYO harness invariant

OpenProse never installs, modifies, or removes the user's harness skills.
Installing skills is the user's responsibility; the compiler only verifies they
are present and stops the compile when they are not.

## Tools

A system, service, or responsibility that depends on host capabilities declares
them in a `### Tools` section. Tool declarations are host capability
requirements: they do not satisfy `### Requires`, do not create Forme
dependency-graph edges, and do not grant or restrict tool use. Use `### Shape`
for service boundaries and prohibited actions.

```markdown
### Tools

- `cli:gh`: GitHub CLI available on PATH for PR inspection
- `cli:jq`: JSON CLI available on PATH for JSON validation
- `mcp:gmail`: MCP server registered with the host
```

The supported deterministic tool declaration shapes are
`cli:<executable-name>` and `mcp:<server-name>`. A CLI executable name is the
command name the host should find by PATH lookup. An MCP server name is the
registered server name the host advertises. Names must be non-empty and must
not contain path separators. Tool declarations belong only in the `### Tools`
section; there is no frontmatter form.

Rules:

- System-level declarations apply to every sub-service inside the system.
  Service-level declarations are additive, not exclusive.
- `cli:<name>` checks only executable presence on PATH. Version ranges, auth
  checks, and installer behavior are outside the declaration.
- `mcp:<name>` checks only server presence in the host MCP registry. The
  compiler does not install, contact, or introspect the server during this
  check.
- For `kind: responsibility`, declared tools are the host capabilities the
  judge may use to observe the contract and that the fulfillment system named
  in `### Fulfillment` may use to act on it. The compiler does not pre-split
  read vs write; capability scope is enforced by the connector adapter at
  runtime.
- Namespaces other than `cli` and `mcp` are reserved. The current compiler
  reports `tool_unsupported_kind` for reserved but unsupported namespaces such
  as `http:example`.
- A malformed declaration, such as `gh`, `cli:`, or `mcp:`, reports
  `tool_invalid`.
- A supported `cli:<name>` declaration that cannot be found on PATH reports
  `tool_unresolved`.
- A supported `mcp:<name>` declaration that cannot be found in the host MCP
  registry reports `tool_unresolved`.
- `prose compile` fails closed when any `tool_invalid`,
  `tool_unsupported_kind`, or `tool_unresolved` diagnostic is emitted.

The compiler program implements this resolution rule; see
`skills/open-prose/compiler/index.prose.md` (`tools_resolver`) for the
program-level contract.

### BYO host tools invariant

OpenProse never installs, modifies, upgrades, or removes host tools. Installing
and authenticating host tools is the user's responsibility; the compiler only
verifies declared tools are present and stops the compile when they are not.

## Frontmatter

Every service, system, gateway, test, pattern, or responsibility declares
identity with `name` and `kind`:

```yaml
---
name: entry-name
kind: service | system | gateway | test | pattern | responsibility
---
```

Frontmatter should stay structural. If a field would be useful to read, review,
or discuss, it should usually be a `###` section.

A `kind: test` file also declares `subject:` to name the service or system it
runs.

A `kind: responsibility` file also declares required `id:` frontmatter to name
the stable Markdown identity for the responsibility. The id is generated once
by tooling as a UUIDv7-compatible 16-byte value, rendered as uppercase
Crockford base32, and preserved across filename and `name:` renames. The slug
is display; `id:` is identity.

## Contract Item Style

Use backticked names followed by a colon:

```markdown
- `topic`: a research question
- `report`: executive-ready summary with sources
```

This is visually clear and easy for agents to extract.

`each` postconditions are contract items:

```markdown
- `articles`: collected articles from the feed
- each article has: a summary, relevance score, and key claims
```

## Typed Caller Inputs

Most `### Requires` entries are free-form values the caller provides at run
time. Two keywords are reserved for passing *completed runs* as inputs — the
typical shape for inspectors, regression checkers, and meta-systems:

```markdown
### Requires

- `subject`: run — a completed run to inspect
- `cohort`: run[] — a set of completed runs to compare
```

When an entry's type is `run` or `run[]`, the caller supplies a run ID (or a
list of them). The Prose VM resolves each ID to its run directory and writes a
structured binding at `bindings/caller/{name}.md` containing the run ID, path,
root source name, and status. The service reads that binding and then reaches into
the run's own `bindings/`, `vm.log.md`, and compiled activation manifest
directly.

See `prose.md` (Run-Typed Inputs) for binding format, resolution order (bare
ID, `~/{id}` for user scope, absolute path), and staleness validation.

## Execution Sections

`### Execution` contains ProseScript. Use a fenced block:

````markdown
### Execution

```prose
let research = call researcher
  topic: topic

return research
```
````

When `### Execution` is present, it is a Level 3 pin: Forme validates contracts
and extracts the call graph, but the Prose VM follows the written order.

## Tests

Test files use the same section grammar. A `kind: test` names a subject service
or system, supplies fixtures as caller inputs, then evaluates semantic
assertions against the subject's public bindings:

```markdown
---
name: test-summarizer
kind: test
subject: summarizer
---

### Fixtures

- `topic`: recent developments in quantum error correction

### Expects

- `summary`: contains at least five bullet points
- `summary`: is under 500 words

### Expects Not

- `summary`: contains fabricated citations
```

Rules:

- `subject:` must name a service or system. Tests do not execute patterns
  directly.
- Path-like subjects use normal service/system resolution. Bare subjects may
  resolve by matching frontmatter `name:` in the test file's directory and
  nearest OpenProse source/package root.
- `### Fixtures` must provide every caller input needed by the subject; tests do
  not prompt the user.
- `### Expects` and `### Expects Not` assert observable behavior, not exact
  phrasing.
- Test reports should list each assertion with pass/fail status and concise
  evidence for failures.

## Design Guidance

Use Contract Markdown when the author cares about the promise more than the
choreography. Use ProseScript when the author needs exact order, control flow,
or human-readable procedural steps.

guidance, load `guidance/authoring.md`.
